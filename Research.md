Authors: Adam Lion-Bouton, Yagmur Ozturk, Agata Savary, Jean-Yves Antoine <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: A paper published at COLING 2022, describing measures of diversity applied to MWEs annotated in 14 languages. <br>

Title: [The PARSEME Shared Task on Automatic Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions](https://aclanthology.org/W17-1704/) <br>
Authors: Agata Savary, Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Cordeiro, Federico Sangati, Veronika Vincze, Behrang QasemiZadeh, Marie Candito, Fabienne Cap, Voula Giouli, Ivelina Stoyanova, Antoine Doucet <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: A paper published at MWE (2017) describing the PARSEM shared task in the identification of multiword expressions (MWEs) and the creation of annotation guidelines, and datasets annotated with verbal MWEs for 18 languages. <br>
Reason for including: Multiword expressions are a linguistic feature that present challenges for many NLP tasks, and this is particularly the case for verbal MWEs. The creation of multilingual annotation guidelines and datasets allows for measuring linguistic diversity across all of these languages for this language feature. <br>

Title: [SemEval-2016 Task 10: Detecting Minimal Semantic Units and their Meanings (DiMSUM)] (https://aclanthology.org/S16-1084/) <br>
Authors: Nathan Schneider, Dirk Hovy, Anders Johannsen, Marine Carpuat <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: A paper published at SemEval-2016 describing the DiMSUM shared task in annotating MWEs and semantic supersenses simultaneously for English sentences across a mixture of domains. <br>
Reason for including: Semantic supersenses and MWEs are both linguistic features that demonstrate semantic diversity. The semantic tagset used offers a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained information. The annotation scheme used to represent MWEs in the data allows for capturing information such as gaps and embedded MWEs. The analysis of the data shows correlation between certain MWEs and supersenses and domain, while the evaluation of the systems shows certain MWE types are more difficult to correctly identify, while others are more trivial, indicating the importance of diversity in these kinds of data. <br>

Title: [A Survey of MWE Identification Experiments: The Devil is in the Details] (https://aclanthology.org/2023.mwe-1.15/) <br>
Authors: Carlos Ramisch, Abigail Walsh, Thomas Blanchard, Shiva Taslimipoor <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: A paper published at MWE Workshop (2023) describing a survey performed on 40 papers describing the task of MWE identification, offering an analysis on the aspects that are reported in these publications. <br>
Reason for including: Survey papers like this one offer a valuable perspective on any given topic, and should be themselves considered a  measure of diversity. This paper reports on the diversity displayed in the reporting of the task of automatic identification of MWEs, in which they themselves often include measures of linguistic diversity. <br>
